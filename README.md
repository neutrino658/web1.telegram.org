Un-Official Un-edited Telegram Web Client

Code from https://github.com/zhukov/webogram/tree/gh-pages

    Don't want to know how this work, but need to access Telegram Web Try below link.
https://web.telegram.ind.in

## Why this Repo?

Telegram is banned in several countries, in India Telegram is blocked on several networks including Jio and Airtel. So in this repo i will continuously provide new domains to access Telegram without compromising privacy or security of your data.

## Blocked URLs by Different Countries

* https://*.web.telegram.org
* `*` can be replaced with ["pluto","venus","aurora","vesta","flora"]
* `*` can be replaced with ["pluto-1","venus-1","aurora-1","vesta-1","flora-1"]
* I've added these APIs directly into base domain/subdomain using Proxy and making it accessible via Single domain.

## List of Domains

* https://web.telegram.org (hosted on Telegram servers, Permanent Domain)
* https://web.telegram.ind.in (Works in All Countries, Please let us know if your country blocks this in future, we'll enable another domain name.)
* https://telegram-web.netlify.app (Another Domain to access)
* https://web-telegram-org.vercel.app (Another Domain to access)

## Telegram Proxy URLs without using VPN

* https://telegram.ind.in
* https://core.telegram.ind.in
* https://web.telegram.ind.in
* https://my.telegram.ind.in
* https://translations.telegram.ind.in
* https://instantview.telegram.ind.in
* https://l.telegram.ind.in/Telegram (Telegram Share System)

## What it does?

* We've changed https://pluto.web.telegram.org to *basedomain*/api/pluto and same for all other URLs.

## Where to deploy

* Currently this App can only be used on Netlify and Vercel.
* Deploying this app directly on any other platform will create known issue and it'll not work at all.

## Deploy on Vercel and Netlify
